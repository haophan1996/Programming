## Implementation

### Part 1: add2

Complete the function `add2`, that will take two integers and adds them together.

### Part 2: isPositive/isNonZero

Complete the functions `isPositive` and `isNonZero`. `isPositive` takes an
integer and returns true if the integer is a positive number, false otherwise.
`isNonZero` takes an integer and returns true if the integer is **not** zero,
false if it is.

### Part 3: bothNonZero

Complete the function `bothNonZero`, which takes in two integers and returns true if both are not zero, false if at
least one is zero.

### Part 4: numTotal

*NOTE: This is taken from the Canadian Computing Competition 2022, Junior.* [[1]](#ref1).

A regular-sized box contains 8 cupcakes, while a small-sized box contains 3 cupcakes.

Cmplete the function `numTotal`, that takes in two parameters: `r`, which contains the number regular-sized boxes, and `s`, which is the number of small-sized boxes. It should return the total number of cupcakes.

If either `r` or `s` is negative, just return 0
