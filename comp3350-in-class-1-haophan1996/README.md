## Documentation

It is important that you properly comment your code and your commits. For comments, F# uses XML documentation which is
similar to Java's Javadoc. An example looks like this:

    /// <summary>Returns the double of x</summary>
    /// <param name="x">The number to double</param>
    /// <returns>The number times 2</returns>

## Implementation

### Part 1: add2

Complete the function `add2`, that will take two integers and adds them together.
